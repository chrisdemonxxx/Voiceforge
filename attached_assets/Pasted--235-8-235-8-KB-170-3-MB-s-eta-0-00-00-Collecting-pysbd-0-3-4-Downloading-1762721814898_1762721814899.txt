ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements-deployment.txt (line 12), -r requirements-deployment.txt (line 18), -r requirements-deployment.txt (line 19), -r requirements-deployment.txt (line 20), -r requirements-deployment.txt (line 26) and numpy==1.24.3 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==1.24.3
    torchvision 0.20.1 depends on numpy
    transformers 4.46.1 depends on numpy>=1.17
    accelerate 0.27.2 depends on numpy>=1.17
    optimum 1.23.3 depends on numpy
    tts 0.22.0 depends on numpy==1.22.0; python_version <= "3.10"

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
